\title{Optimal Ticket Allocation for Overbooking}
\usage{
ntickets(N, gamma, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Numeric. The capacity (number of available seats).}

\item{gamma}{Numeric. The target probability that the number of ticket holders showing up
will not exceed the capacity. Must be between 0 and 1 (exclusive).}

\item{p}{Numeric. The probability that an individual ticket holder shows up. Must be between
0 and 1 (exclusive).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{nd}{Optimal number of tickets for the discrete case.}
\item{nc}{Optimal number of tickets for the normal approximation case.}
\item{N}{The capacity used for calculations.}
\item{p}{The probability of a ticket holder showing up.}
\item{gamma}{The target probability used for calculations.}
}

\examples{
# Example usage with capacity 100, gamma 0.05, and show-up probability 0.9
ntickets(N = 100, gamma = 0.05, p = 0.9)

# Example with a different show-up probability
ntickets(N = 120, gamma = 0.1, p = 0.85)
