\title{Histogram of Sample Means with Overlaid Density Curves}
\usage{
newfunctionfromabove(n, iter, a = 0, b = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Numeric. The sample size for each iteration.}

\item{iter}{Numeric. The number of iterations (number of samples drawn).}

\item{a}{Numeric. The lower bound of the uniform distribution. Default is 0.}

\item{b}{Numeric. The upper bound of the uniform distribution. Default is 10.}
}
\value{
None. The function generates a plot with a histogram and density curves.

\examples{
# Generate a histogram of sample means with 100 samples, 1000 iterations,
# and a uniform distribution between 0 and 10
newfunctionfromabove(n = 100, iter = 1000, a = 0, b = 10)

# Change the bounds of the uniform distribution
newfunctionfromabove(n = 50, iter = 500, a = -5, b = 5)
